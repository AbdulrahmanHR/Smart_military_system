TACTICAL PROCEDURES MANUAL
==========================

CHAPTER 1: DEFENSIVE PERIMETER ESTABLISHMENT

1.1 Overview
A defensive perimeter is a crucial tactical formation used to secure an area and protect personnel and equipment. This procedure is essential for establishing temporary bases, protecting supply lines, and maintaining security during stationary operations.

1.2 Standard Procedures for Defensive Perimeter

STEP 1: RECONNAISSANCE AND SITE SELECTION
- Conduct thorough reconnaissance of the area
- Identify high ground and natural defensive positions
- Assess fields of fire and potential enemy approach routes
- Check for adequate water sources and supply access
- Ensure communication capabilities throughout the perimeter

STEP 2: PERIMETER LAYOUT
- Establish primary defensive positions in a circular or polygonal pattern
- Position key weapons systems (machine guns, anti-tank weapons) at critical points
- Create overlapping fields of fire between positions
- Establish clear sectors of responsibility for each unit
- Mark safe passage routes for friendly forces

STEP 3: FORTIFICATION
- Dig fighting positions appropriate to threat level and time available
- Establish observation posts at elevated positions
- Create protective barriers using available materials
- Set up camouflage and concealment measures
- Install early warning systems and tripwires

STEP 4: COMMUNICATION NETWORK
- Establish primary and secondary communication methods
- Position radio operators at key command posts
- Create visual and audio signal systems for emergency situations
- Test all communication equipment regularly
- Establish check-in schedules with higher command

1.3 Security Considerations
- Maintain 360-degree security at all times
- Rotate guard duties to prevent fatigue
- Establish quick reaction forces for immediate response
- Plan withdrawal routes and rally points
- Coordinate with adjacent units for mutual support

CHAPTER 2: PATROL FORMATIONS

2.1 Standard Patrol Formations

WEDGE FORMATION
- Used in open terrain with good visibility
- Point man leads, followed by team in wedge shape
- Provides excellent all-around security
- Allows rapid movement and fire distribution

COLUMN FORMATION
- Used in thick terrain or limited visibility
- Single file movement with designated intervals
- Reduces noise and maintains unit cohesion
- Requires careful rear security measures

DIAMOND FORMATION
- Used when 360-degree security is critical
- Four-person teams in diamond pattern
- Central command position for coordination
- Effective for reconnaissance missions

2.2 Movement Techniques
- Use proper hand and arm signals for silent communication
- Maintain appropriate intervals between personnel
- Rotate point man duties to prevent fatigue
- Conduct regular security halts for observation
- Practice immediate action drills for contact situations
